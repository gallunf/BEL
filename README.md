Basic English Lexicon (BEL) sentence recognition materials, from Calandruccio and Smiljanic (2012).

"Although these materials share some facets with existing sentence lists (e.g., Bamford-Kowal-Bench [BKB] and Speech Perception in Noise Test [SPIN]), they are distinguished by two important features. First, they are based on a basic English lexicon derived from naturalistic interactions with non-native speakers. We use “basic” here to indicate vocabulary used by nonnative talkers in conversations discussing everyday topics. Second, they comprise a large set of original sentences (500 total with 2,000 keywords). These design features should allow for less linguistically biased speech recognition and hearing assessments of both native and non-native listener groups as well as for testing of multiple experimental conditions." Calandruccio and Smiljanic (2012)

The repository comprises three sets of recordings, provided by L. Callandruccio (personal communication)
The first is the complete set of BEL sentences, spoken by three talkers
The second is are the HINT sentences, spoken by the same three talkers
The third are the QuickSIN sentences, spoken by the same three talkers

Also included are a variety of published papers, provided as reference for these materials and for personal use only, not for re-distribution, as the creative commons copyright does not apply to them.
