Basic English Lexicon (BEL) sentence recognition materials, from Calandruccio and Smiljanic (2012).

"Although these materials share some facets with
existing sentence lists (e.g., Bamford-Kowal-Bench
[BKB] and Speech Perception in Noise Test [SPIN]),
they are distinguished by two important features.
First, they are based on a basic English lexicon derived
from naturalistic interactions with non-native speakers.
We use “basic” here to indicate vocabulary used by nonnative
talkers in conversations discussing everyday
topics. Second, they comprise a large set of original sentences
(500 total with 2,000 keywords). These design features
should allow for less linguistically biased speech
recognition and hearing assessments of both native
and non-native listener groups as well as for testing of
multiple experimental conditions." Calandruccio and Smiljanic (2012)
